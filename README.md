## How does the game works?
Start the application by running the UserIO.py file. Enter your name and press enter to start the game.

The pong is controlled automatically. You can control the snake with the arrow keys.

You can score a point by pushing the ball to the left wall on the field. Your opponent gets a point when the ball gets to the right side of the field.

If someone scores 5 points the game is over.

Your opponent also gets a point when you crash your snake into a wall or if the snake hits itself.
